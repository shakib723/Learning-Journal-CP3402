Learning Activities
This week the task was to make a joomla site.


Estimated Hours
I spent about 4 hours of my own time this week on this subject, not including time I spent on the assignment.

Content Insights
As this is the first practical for joomla use, the requirement was not really specific. So I watched the video and started discovering the tools can be used in wordpress to make a website.


Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing the practical, I started to look at the LinkedIn Learning course on joomla to see if they gave any more insight that I did not obtain from the work I did in the practical. I have concluded that this approach to learning could be effective, but looking at guides, then doing some of the work, then going back to tutorials works better for me, as I discussed in an earlier week.
