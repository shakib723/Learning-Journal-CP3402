Learning ACTIVITES:
I hypothesise that continuous reading for at least one hour every day throughout the semester will help me retain more information about the subject than cramming before the weekly practical submission deadline. Consistency is the repetition of an action or the maintenance of a state as a result of a particular action. Consistency is important to help you discover routines and methods that work for you and your routines throughout your life. Once you commit to being more consistent, you will develop regular routines and find it simpler to make plans and schedules.
In order to verify this hypothesis, I will split my research into two weeks. In one week, I will determine whether or not I am able to fulfil the commitment. And one week I will perform the experiment with relative ease and without as much concentration as I should have.
During the first week, I will review all the essential slides and view relevant videos on LinkedIn. I am still sorting out how to properly create a custom WordPress theme. I will complete all LinkedIn courses and concentrate on my group assignment. 
On the alternate week, I will continue to complete my assigned tasks, but I will not do so consistently. I'm eager to determine whether or not this works. I have issues with the consistency of actions and If, during the first week, I observe changes in my grasp of the subject, I will maintain my consistency.


ESTIMATED HOUR: 1 hour

CONTENT INSIGHTS: This week learning activites is based on the scientific method where we can figure out a issue and test it according to our self. 

Career Employability: It's good for self experiment and figuring out the self-judgement and what can be done about it.
