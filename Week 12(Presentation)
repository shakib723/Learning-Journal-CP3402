<h1>Learning activities</h1>: For this week practical, me and my group had to rehearse our presentation and submit the video file in learnjcu.

Estimated Hour: 2 hour

Content insight: To give a successful presentation, you need to practise. Rehearsing gives you more confidence, makes sure you know your subject, and gives you a chance to improve your presentation skills. Not only is it important to practise giving your speech, but it is also important to practise using your visual tools.

Career employability: When students come up with creative and interesting slides to show what they are talking about, this helps them come up with new ideas. Using presentation tools makes a talk much more interesting, and making them can help students build their confidence.
