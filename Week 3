Learning activities: This week I made a wesbite in wordpress with the help of editing tools. I used elementor as my editing tools. (https://youtu.be/yC6ZfIF-R9k)
Estimated hours: I spent around 5 hours all total to make the website. This include the video watching and creating the website.
Content insights: As this is the first practical for wordpress use, the requirement was not really specific. So I watched the video and started discovering the tools can be used in wordpress to make a website.
